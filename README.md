Noted, the dodgeBall game has buttons. Some features are following:

    changing the speed of the enemy balls that are falling;
    change the shapes of the balls are falling;
    play music while game is playing.

The player use mouse to change the location of the player's ball. The enemy balls are falling down from the top to bottom.

There is minor issue with the ball's start over function. The survival time doesn't start over until the start over button is clicked.
